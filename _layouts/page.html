<On the other hand, software engineering will be concerned with the production, creation, and development of entirely new software or from the essential software. Next, the lecture deals with the issue of doing an internship before receiving an official university degree. The teacher gave us names of tech companies that we might be interning. It helps me to have a clear direction about the company I want to work for in the future. In addition, it also creates motivation and confidence for me to work hard and continue to improve myself and absorb new knowledge at RMIT. Third, the teacher introduced me to the subjects available in the IT field. He also gave me background information about the subjects we would take in my first year and the number of credits I have to complete in a course. Especially at RMIT, students must complete introductory courses to be eligible for advanced courses. This information will help me better understand what I will be learning in my first year and be able to plan my studies soon. Finally, Dr. Jonathan Crellin reminds us of the school's management regulations in students' learning process. Plagiarism is one of the acts the university will severely punish, and he also gave me examples of plagiarism. Students who make such mistakes may fail the course or be expelled. They are one of those valuable pieces of information that I must always keep in mind because if I get it wrong, it can directly affect my learning. At the same time, I can also find a solution to prevent plagiarism from that information.
